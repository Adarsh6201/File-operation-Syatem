# File-operation-Syatem
 The file operation Application is a python-based desktop application that  provides users with a graphical interface to perform file operation, such as  copying or moving file, based on there type and specified extensions. 


# To run the provided code, you'll need to ensure you have Python installed on your system, along with the required libraries. Here is a step-by-step guide to running the code:

Install Python:
Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download and install it from the official Python website.

Install Required Libraries:
The code uses several external libraries, which you need to install. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following commands to install them:

pip install pillow
pip install tk

On Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
sudo dnf install python3-tkinter



To run the provided code, you'll need the following Python packages:

Pillow for image processing.
tkinter for the GUI (note that tkinter is included with standard Python installations, but you might need to install python-tk on some systems).
Here's the full list of packages and the corresponding pip install commands:

bash
pip install pillow
pip install tk
However, note that tkinter usually comes pre-installed with Python. If you're using a system that separates tkinter from the core Python package (like some Linux distributions), you might need to install python-tk separately using your system's package manager.

On Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:
sudo apt-get install python3-tk


On Fedora-based systems:
sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
